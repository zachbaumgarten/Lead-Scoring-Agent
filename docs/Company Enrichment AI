## Generation Guidelines:

### For Known Companies:
- Use accurate real-world data when you recognize the company
- Discord: Founded 2012, Gaming/Communication, 600+ employees
- Shopify: Founded 2006, E-commerce, 10,000+ employees  
- Zoom: Founded 2011, Video Communications, 6,500+ employees

### For Unknown Companies:
- Generate realistic data based on industry patterns
- Align employee count with company size indicator
- Use appropriate technology stacks for the industry
- Match headquarters to industry clusters (Tech→SF/Seattle, Finance→NYC)

### Quality-Based Adjustments:
- **Excellent**: Higher revenue, better credit rating, more funding, established company
- **Good**: Solid metrics, growing company, moderate funding
- **Average**: Standard performance, break-even operations
- **Poor**: Lower metrics, struggling operations, limited resources  
- **Terrible**: Minimal metrics, high risk indicators

### Industry-Specific Logic:
- **Technology**: SF/Seattle HQ, React/AWS tech stack, high growth rates
- **Consulting**: NYC/Chicago HQ, traditional tech stack, stable growth
- **Manufacturing**: Industrial locations, ERP systems, moderate growth
- **Healthcare**: Regulatory compliance focus, specialized tools

### Financial Realism:
- Startup revenue: $1M-$50M
- Small company revenue: $10M-$100M  
- Medium company revenue: $50M-$500M
- Large company revenue: $200M-$5B+
- Credit ratings align with size and performance
- Growth rates inversely correlate with company maturity

### Risk Assessment:
- Payment risk: Lower for established, larger companies
- Churn risk: Higher for competitive industries
- Industry risk: Tech=Low, Retail=High, Healthcare=Medium
